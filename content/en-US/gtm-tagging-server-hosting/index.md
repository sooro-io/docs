# Overview

Server-side tagging helps you improve your tracking by offloading some or all of your tracking to dedicated servers. This eliminates many of the restrictions that exists in browsers and apps, meaning that event quantity and quality can be improved. A number of other advantages can also be achieved, such as improved page performance or increased data protection.

A suitable start into the world of server-side tagging are the possibilities of the Google Tag Manager, or more precisely: the server containers. Similar to the regular GTM containers, you can exchange data with third parties by using tags, triggers, variables and functions. In order for the server containers to be used, tagging servers are necessary. We take care of hosting these servers for you so that you can focus on your tracking integrations. We also take on the infrastructure and all associated tasks.

On the following pages you will find everything you need to get started straight away. Under [get started](/content/en-US/gtm-tagging-server-hosting/get-started.md) we will guide you through the creation of your GTM Tagging Servers and also lead you through the configuration in the GTM. You are then ready to implement your first server-side tags.
